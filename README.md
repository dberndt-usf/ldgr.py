# ldgr.py
The <b>ldgr.py</b> toolkit supports flow of funds agent-based models with a shared ledger framework.  The project began while building our second financial system agent-based model.  The first model investigated the dynamics of the US corporate bond market (see <a href=" https://doi.org/10.3390/systems5040054">doi.org/10.3390/systems5040054</a>).  The second model focused on the US Federal Reserve, along with the banking sector that maintains reserve accounts using a flow-of-funds perspective.  One way the Fed can affect the money supply is through <i>quantitative easing</i> (QE) and <i>quantitative tightening</i> (QT) policies.
